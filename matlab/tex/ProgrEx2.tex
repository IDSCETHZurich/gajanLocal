\large\textbf{Policy Iteration, Value Iteration and Linear Programming}
\end{center}
\medskip

Consider the task of driving an under powered car up a steep mountain road as shown below. Assume that the car remains on the road at all times.
\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.6]{img/mceps.eps}
\end{center}
\end{figure}

The maximum acceleration of the car, $u$, along the road in both directions is limited to $u_{\mathrm{max}}>0$. The discrete time dynamics of the car is given by
\begin{eqnarray}
v_{k+1} &=& v_k + a_x(v_k,x_k,u_k) \Delta t,  \nonumber \\
x_{k+1} &=& x_k + v_k  \Delta t + 0.5 a_x(v_k,x_k,u_k) {\Delta t}^2,  \nonumber
\end{eqnarray}
where $v_k$, $x_k$ are the velocity and position of the car along the horizontal direction ($x$-direction), $\Delta t$ is the discrete time interval, $a_x$ is the acceleration along the horizontal direction is given by,
\begin{equation}
a_x(v_k,x_k,u_k) = -\frac{\sin x_k \cos x_k}{1+\sin^2 x_k} {v_k}^2 -  \frac{\sin x_k}{1+\sin^2 x_k} g -\frac{1}{(1+\sin^2 x_k)^\frac{3}{2}} u_k \nonumber, 
\end{equation}
and $g$ is the gravitational acceleration. 

The goal is find the optimal policy that takes the car to the mountain top, $x\ =\ \pi $ or  $x\ =\ -\pi $, starting from any given postion $x_0 \in (-\pi,\pi)$ and $v_0 \in (-1,1)$ in minimal time (time optimal policy). Three different algorithms are to be implemented to solve this problem:
\begin{itemize}
	\item[(i)] Policy Iteration
	\item[(ii)] Value Iteration: The result of (i) might be used to provide a meaningful stopping criterion for the value iteration algorithm. 
	\item[(iii)] Linear Programming
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection*{Deliverables}
Please hand in by e-mail
\begin{itemize}
\item your implementation of the above three algorithms along with the following function implementation:
 
{\tt [T,Xstar,Ustar,TE] = progEx2Solver(x0, g, opt)} 

\textbf{Input}

\subitem {\tt x0}: vector of initial conditions $[v_0, x_0]^{\mathrm{T}}$
\subitem {\tt g}: gravitational acceleration
\subitem {\tt opt}: algorithm option ({\tt 'valIt', 'polIt', 'linProg'})

\textbf{Output}
\subitem {\tt T}: column vector of time points.
\subitem {\tt Xstar}: optimal-state array. Each row in Xstar corresponds to the state at a time returned in the corresponding row of T.
\subitem {\tt Ustar}: optimal-input array. Each row in Xstar corresponds to the state at a time returned in the corresponding row of T.
\subitem{\tt TE}: The time at which the reaches the top $x\ =\ \pi $ or  $x\ =\ -\pi $
\item surf plot of the cost-to-go values against the states, $v_k$ and $x_k$.
\item in a PDF file, answers to the following question
\begin{enumerate}
\item Physical interpretation of optimal policy
\item Physical interpretation of the discontinuities cost-to-go plots
\end{enumerate}
\end{itemize}
Please include all files into one {\tt zip}-file, which you name {\tt DPOCEx2\_Names.zip}, where {\it Names} is a list of the full names of all students who have worked on the solution.\footnote{Up to three students are allowed to work together on the problem.  They will all receive the same grade.}  
\smallskip 

Send your file to Gajan ({\tt gajan@ethz.ch}) until the due date indicated above.  We will send a confirmation e-mail upon receiving your e-mail.  You are ultimately responsible that we receive your solution in time.

vidual student) listed as author conrms that the work is original, has been done by the
author(s) independently and that s/he has read and understood the \textit{ETH Citation etiquette}
(http://www.ethz.ch/students/exams/plagiarism s en.pdf ). Each work submitted will be tested
